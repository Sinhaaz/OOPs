# Programming Structures

In programming languages there are basically two approaches : 
  -  POPs (Procedural Oriented Programming Structure)
  -  OOPs (Object Oriented Programming Structure)

## OOPs (Object Oriented Programming Structure)

>- OOPs stands on 4 pillars :
>- 1. Polymorphism
>- 2. Encapsulation
>- 3. Inheritance
>- 4. Data Abstraction

### 1. Polymorphism
**Poly means many and morphism means form**
Same object having different behaivours.

**There are 2 types of Polymorphism:-**
- Compile time polymorphism
- Runtime polymorphism

#### Compile Time Polymorphism
A polymorphism which exists at the time of compilation is called Compile Time Polymorphism

**Ex: Method Overloading**
- When a class contains more than one method with same name and different types and different number of parameters.
- - ex: int pol(int a)
  -     int pol(int a,int b)

#### Runtime Polymorphism
